                 <h2>DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>
                 <p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.

                    Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.
                    
                    Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.
                    
                    Graduates of University of Maryland’s Computer Science Department are lifetime learners; they are able to adapt quickly with this challenging field</p>

                 <h2>DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRONICS</h2>
                 <p>One of the earliest electronic inventions was the vacuum tube, a discovery that would revolutionize the modern world and give way to photography, radio, television, and long-distance telephony.

                    Today, from smartphones to laptops, electronics engineering technology has come to dominate our daily lives, making electrical engineering, and electrical power engineering, which deals primarily with the transmission of electrical power, continually growing fields.
                    
                    For students interested in electrical engineering courses, you can explore basic electrical and electronics engineering, computation structures, electronic interfaces and the principles of electric circuits through a wide range of online courses.
                    
                    Whether you are interested in pursuing an electrical engineering degree, landing an electrical engineering internship, or you want to gain more general electrical engineering information, the field of electronics is vast and offers countless opportunities for the applied study of electrical engineering.
                    
                    A diverse set of online learning tools are available today; enabling would-be students to think beyond electrical engineering books, and enroll in an interactive and engaging electronics courses online.</p>

                 <h2>DEPARTMENT OF MATHMATICS</h2>
                 <p>mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th century, mathematics has been an indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences and technology, and in more recent times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences</p>

                 <h2>DEPARTMENT OF GEOGRAPHY</h2>
                 <p>Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environments. Geographers explore both the physical properties of Earth’s surface and the human societies spread across it. They also examine how human culture interacts with the natural environment and the way that locations and places can have an impact on people. Geography seeks to understand where things are found, why they are there, and how they develop and change over time.</p>

                 <h2>DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS</h2>
                 <p>Economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make choices about how to allocate resources. Economics focuses on the actions of human beings, based on assumptions that humans act with rational behavior, seeking the most optimal level of benefit or utility. The building blocks of economics are the studies of labor and trade. Since there are many possible applications of human labor and many different ways to acquire resources, it is the task of economics to determine which methods yield the best results.</p>

                 <h2>DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE</h2>
                 <p>Biology is the study of life. The word "biology" is derived from the Greek words "bios" (meaning life) and "logos" (meaning "study"). In general, biologists study the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution and distribution of living organisms.
                    Biology is important because it helps us understand how living things work and how they function and interact on multiple levels, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. Advances in biology have helped scientists do things such as develop better medicines and treatments for diseases, understand how a changing environment might affect plants and animals, produce enough food for a growing human population and predict how eating new food or sticking to an exercise regimen might affect our bodies.</p>

                 <h2>DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICES</h2>
                 <p>physics, science that deals with the structure of matter and the interactions between the fundamental constituents of the observable universe. In the broadest sense, physics (from the Greek physikos) is concerned with all aspects of nature on both the macroscopic and submicroscopic levels. Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of objects under the action of given forces but also the nature and origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force fields. Its ultimate objective is the formulation of a few comprehensive principles that bring together and explain all such disparate phenomena.</p>

                 <h2>DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY</h2>
                 <p>Chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes. Every substance, whether naturally occurring or artificially produced, consists of one or more of the hundred-odd species of atoms that have been identified as elements. Although these atoms, in turn, are composed of more elementary particles, they are the basic building blocks of chemical substances; there is no quantity of oxygen, mercury, or gold, for example, smaller than an atom of that substance. Chemistry, therefore, is concerned not with the subatomic domain but with the properties of atoms and the laws governing their combinations and how the knowledge of these properties can be used to achieve specific purposes.</p>
